I wanted to try the trail system but couldn't manage to implemet it properly.
Then i tried to use the particle system.
I managed to make a trail of a particle via trail module in particle system it was working properly,
but i couldnt manage to use the collider module of the particle system.
After trying with particle system to make a trail of a particle or an object and failed to make it work properly
I made a custom animation and used it for bullet as pang's Arrow's Chain.
I familiarized myself with some new components such as animator, animation, particle system and trail renderer.
In the end i solved my problem using animation.
The balloon spawning was not that hard. It took an hour in implementation and 3 hours in debugging hehe.
